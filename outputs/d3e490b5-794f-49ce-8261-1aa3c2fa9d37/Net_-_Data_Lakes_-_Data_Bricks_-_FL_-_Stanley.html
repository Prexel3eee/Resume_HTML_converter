However, based on culture, funding models, and a lack of central oversight, the code related to existing applications and new initiatives is isolated (siloed) from the rest of the domain, resulting in duplicity and inefficiency.</p><p> </p><p>My primary role is to increase profits through a centralized framework (SOA), that reduces costs and time to market by enabling access, reuse, and ease of extensibility of both new and siloed enterprise assets. The details follow below:</p><p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong></p><p><strong>Azure: </strong>Worked with Azure in a Hybrid Cloud context: Service hosting and related tasks are being migrated to Azure according to a “Transition Plan.” The transition is being facilitated by Azure Service Bus Relay which directs service requests to the appropriate handler (WCF) in the cloud or on premise. Azure BizTalk Services are also part of the mix. Other Azure Tasks include the development of ARM Templates, Azure Active Directory, Azure Application Gateway &amp; WAF,  Azure Storage (Blob &amp; Table) and SQL Server.</p><p><strong>Micros-Services:</strong> developed granular micro-services, targeting E-Commerce, as part of the general service inventory. Each Micro-Service runs in its own Application Domain (Application in IIS) and each Micro-Service has its own Application Pool and data-source.  </p><p><strong>.Net Core: </strong>Implemented via VS 2015, including use of Linux and Windows Docker Containers. </p><p><strong>Created Core Infrastructures via the ESB &amp; Orchestration Design Patterns: </strong>For synchronous business processes, I implemented the Orchestration Design Pattern. This pattern exposes a central layer of services that contain “Business Process Logic.”  It typically works by leveraging middleware (in the instant case, <strong><em>Appian</em> </strong>and <strong><em>Windows Workflow Foundation</em> </strong>for SOAP Services, <strong><em>BizTalk Server</em></strong> for Restful Services), where each step of a business process defined within an Orchestration Service is realized via the execution of a reusable component/service. In this way, new applications can be “assembled” via existing assets, rather than developed from “scratch.” For Asynchronous messaging patterns between disparate systems with uncertain availability, and potentially the need for translation of protocols/data models, I am implementing the ESB Design Pattern. Here, the steps required to translate received messages into a format and/or protocol required by the recipient are defined via an “Itinerary.”  To facilitate the implementation of the pattern, I am using the <strong><em>BizTalk ESB Toolkit and MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queing) and using OSB—Oracle Service Bus—for supply chain).</em></strong></p><p><strong>Implemented the “Three Layer Inventory Pattern:” </strong>This pattern complements Orchestration via 2 additional layers: A Business Services Layer, where the Services encapsulate business logic related to the entities they represent (e.g. customer, invoice, vehicle, etc.), and an Application Services Layer where the Services are typically devoid of business rules, but have highly reusable application logic (e.g. a Logging Service, Email Service, Data Access Service, etc.—this layer also includes “Wrapper Services” that enable integration with legacy and third party applications). The purpose of the pattern is to optimize reuse (Micro Service Strategy). </p><p><strong>Created Criteria for Integration of Appian BPM and SOA Orchestrations.</strong></p><p><strong>Creating an Enterprise Ontology</strong>: Acts as a resource for enabling SOA Automation of Business Models and the discovery of Data Transfer Objects and Entity Centric Business Services. </p><p><strong>Introduced a SOA Delivery Strategy: </strong>Inclusive of  SDLC Options such as Waterfall, RUP, and Agile. One major purpose of the strategy is to ensure automation of Enterprise Business Models. The strategy encapsulates the essentials of the IBM SOMA paradigm.</p><p><strong>Implemented a Flexible and Extensible Security Model: </strong>inclusive of message security, transport security, and Single Sign On (SAML, OAUTH, OpenIDConnect &amp; Custom).</p><p><strong>Compiled a SOA Governance Reference Model: </strong>Acts as a template for a SOA Governance Model, unique to the target organization. Includes Portfolio Governance and Portfolio Rationalization, Organizational Governance, Vitality Governance, and Lifecycle Governance.</p><p><strong>Created a Ryder SOA Reference Architecture and Implementation: </strong>Asserts standards , including examples, for development. The reference is organized according to the UML 4-1 View of an architecture.</p><p><strong>Created a SOA Transition Plan: </strong>Itemizes the initial state, desired state, and intermediate states of the target being transformed. It also includes an Impact Analysis, Gap Analysis, and integration with a Centralized Security Model.</p><p><strong>Created/Coded a Virtual Data Layer: </strong>As per a previous assignment<strong>, </strong>accomplished this via a combination of the Table Gateway and Abstract Factory Patterns. The basis for the Virtual Data Layer is to enable Database Federation (an integration strategy where multiple autonomous databases appear to act as one—differences in Data Models with respect to like entities are being resolved via a “canonical schema” in the Data Transfer Objects.</p><p><strong>Implemented/Coded a Publish/Subscribe Framework (Enables SOA 2.0, Complex Event Driven Architectures): </strong>As per the previous assignment, the framework is multithreaded and highly scalable. It decouples the event publishers from the event subscribers so that it possible to subscribe to an event without knowledge of the publisher (and vice versa). A major purpose is to enable SOA 2.0 processing (SOA 2.0 monitors low level events that have an effect on the profitability or efficiency of an enterprise. When such an event is triggered, it is forwarded to a subscriber that takes the appropriate action(s) to optimize profits).</p><p><strong>Implemented the Canonical Schema Pattern: </strong>Enables greater reuse of services: While data models for enterprise entities may vary, a canonical schema at the SOA level presents one version of an entity (Data Transfer Object) that accommodates all data models within the enterprise.</p><p><strong>Created an Enterprise, Real-Time Cache:</strong> Leveraged Windows Server AppFabric to create cache clusters with high capacities and availability. Leveraged the Pub/Sub Framework (described previously) and Canonical schemas so Cache was always up-to-date and cached objects were shareable by multiple applications.</p><p><strong>Implemented the Data Transfer Object Pattern: </strong>This pattern improves performance by enabling Coarse Grained Interfaces that reduce the number of Remote Method Calls required to realize a business task. </p><p><strong>Created/Creating UML Analysis and Design Artifacts:</strong> Inclusive of Use Cases, Analysis Class Diagrams (including Domain Model/Ontology), Sequence Diagrams (including Use Case Realizations), Activity Diagrams, Component Diagrams, Deployment Diagrams, Class Diagrams (including Active Classes—Process View), and others in support of  the classic UML 4-1 View of an Architecture. </p><p><strong>Data Modeling: OLTP, OLAP, MDM, Big Data (Hadoop)</strong></p><p><strong>Developed Integration Strategies for Mobility, Legacy and Third Party Assets: </strong>Based on Wrapper Services in Orchestrations,  an ESB strategy for disparate systems, or a combination of both, particularly within Supply Chain Scenarios.</p><p><strong>Proposed a Database Transition Plan from a Federated Set of Databases to a One Source Repository: </strong>Strategy is based on a Canonical Schema derived at the application level. Common Attributes of an Entity define the Parent, while sets of attributes that are aggregated at the application level and that extend the entity so that it is consistent with differing data models become Category Entities in Logical DB parlance.</p><p><strong>Coded Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Workflow Services, inclusive of externalized rules and Java Integration.</strong></p><p><strong>Coded/Developed Restful Services via ASP.NET Web API</strong></p><p><strong>Coded/Created BizTalk Orchestrations, Itineraries (ESB Toolkit), and ancillaries –including Business Rules Engine (BRE).</strong></p><p><strong>Coded Components implementing Multi-Threading: </strong>For the most part, I utilized the Microsoft Task Parallel Library.</p><p><strong>Coded/Developed Micro Services</strong></p><p><strong>Made/Making Presentations to Diverse Audiences:</strong> Business Stakeholders, Project Managers, Business Analysts, Third Party Vendors, Developers, etc.</p><p><strong>Acted as Mentor to Both Junior and Senior Developers: </strong>e.g. WCF, WF (Windows Workflow Foundation), C#, VB.Net ASP.Net, ASP.Net MVC 4.0, ASP.Net Web API, jQuery, Unity, HTML 5, Multi-Threading, troubleshooting/debugging, etc.</p><p><strong>Cloud Integration: Azure--</strong>IAAS, PAAS, XAAS, SAAS<strong>--</strong> WCF Services, BizTalk Services, and SQL database.</p><p><strong>Mobile Device Integration:</strong> Includes prototyping via Xamarin (Android, IOS, and Windows Phone) Studio and Enterprise Integration via Restful Services.</p><p><strong>Designing/Developing Mobile App Store Infrastructure: </strong>Mobile Device Downloads.</p><p><strong>Mainframe Integration:</strong> Host Integration Server &amp; SOA Wrapper Services</p><p><strong>Configured Development, QA, and Production Servers: </strong>Windows Server 2012<strong>, </strong>Inclusive of IIS and WSAT Protocol.</p><p><strong>Implemented Tests:</strong> Unit, Integration, and Load.

As such, it </p><p>maintains a competitive tax practice serving a diverse, global clientele having a variety of business structures. In particular, my role was to design an architecture that would fully support their Partnership Tax Practice and have the capability to perform complex calculations on millions of assets. Additionally, the architecture was required to integrate their existing partnership applications, provide the ability to perform “What If” calculations over large sets of data, enable the printing of tax forms, along with other relevant tasks, including the potential support for database federation. The details follow below:</p><p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong></p><p><strong>Created Basic infrastructure via the “Orchestration Design Pattern”-- </strong>The pattern works by treating requests as business processes. Steps within a business process are handled via a core of highly reusable services, discovered through a Service Oriented Analysis. Reuse is achieved by isolating different types of logic into distinct layers (i.e. Orchestration Services Layer, Business Services Layer, and an Application Services Layer).  </p><p><strong>Created an “Ontology,” based on the Tax Practice—</strong>This was accomplished by creating a UML Domain Model (Analysis Class Diagram), expressing the Tax Practice Business Vocabulary as classes, and showing the relationships between the classes. The Ontology/Domain Model was used for the discovery of Entity Centric Business Services and Data Transfer Objects.</p><p><strong>Aligned the relevant Business Models to the Ontology: </strong>This process facilitated SOA Automation for the targeted Business Models.</p><p><strong>Implemented/Coded a “Virtual Data Layer”—A</strong>ccomplished this via a combination of the Table Gateway and Factory Method Patterns. The basis for the Virtual Data Layer is to enable Database Federation (an integration strategy where multiple autonomous databases appear to act as one—differences in Data Models with respect to like entities are being resolved via a “canonical schema” in the Data Transfer Objects.</p><p><strong>Implemented/Coded a Publish-Subscribe Framework (Enables SOA 2.0, Complex Event Driven Architecture)--</strong>The framework is multithreaded and highly scalable. It decouples the event publishers from the event subscribers so that it possible to subscribe to an event without knowledge of the publisher (and vice versa). Its main purpose is to enable SOA 2.0 processing (SOA 2.0 monitors low level events that have an effect on the profitability or efficiency of an enterprise. When such an event is triggered, it is forwarded to a subscriber that takes the appropriate action(s) to optimize profits.)</p><p><strong>Implementing/coding a Chunking and Streaming Framework—</strong>Purpose is to prevent breaches of the hardware limits and to improve performance when performing complex calculations over huge sets of data. A chunking strategy delivers manageable subsets of data for processing (each subset is processed, one subset at a time, until all the data is processed). Streaming relates to the fact that data is normally buffered over the wire with Web Services. This means that all the data needs to arrive before any processing can be done. With large chunks this causes a performance hit. My framework avoids this through custom streaming classes so that the streamed data can be processed immediately, without waiting for the entire chunk to arrive.</p><p><strong>Implementation of Database Designs</strong>—Includes design of both Transactional and Dimensional Databases. Transactional model was delivered in third normal form. </p><p><strong>Integrated</strong> <strong>key legacy and third party applications—</strong>Utilized Database Federation, described above and “Wrapper Application Services.” These types of services provide a Wrapper around legacy or third party applications so that their functionality can be exposed via Web Services. Under the hood, they utilize the appropriate technologies to communicate with the “Wrapped” applications (e.g. COM interop, WSE, etc).</p><p><strong>Introduced a SOA Governance Reference Model—</strong>Due to the complexity of an Enterprise SOA, Governance is essential. Key parts of the Governance Reference Model are being implemented for the Tax Practice.</p><p><strong>Creating a SOA Reference Architecture—</strong>inclusive of a reference implementation.<strong> </strong>This artifact maintains Architectural Integrity by providing guidance for development. I organized it according to the classic UML 4-1 View of an architecture.</p><p><strong>Acted as Technical Lead for Onshore &amp; Offshore Resources—</strong>This involved prototyping and formal presentations.</p><p><strong>Technologies: </strong></p><p><strong>Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) 4.0 Workflow Services: </strong>Used in the Orchestration Services Layer, they implement the Business Processes of the application as Workflows. For volatile process logic (based on the volatility of certain tax laws and algorithms), an external rules file is being used so that the rules can be changed externally, without the need to recompile and redeploy the application. </p><p><strong>Windows Communication Foundation 4.0 (WCF): </strong>Services have multiple endpoints to accommodate a variety of clients. Use is also made of WCF Instance <br/>Management, Operation Management, Concurrency Management, Transaction <br/>Management and Security where appropriate.</p><p><strong>BizTalk Server (</strong>ESB Toolkit): used to facilitate asynchronous communication between disparate systems with potentially unknown availability (protocol/data translation, data enrichment, dynamic routing, queuing, etc). Rest Services: exposed Restful Endpoints utilizing webHttpBinding. Both Service Behaviors and Custom Pipelines were prototyped for converting JSON to XML within BizTalk Orchestrations. Through BizTalk Adapters, integration was enabled with SAP, Seibel, and PeopleSoft.</p><p><strong>Microsoft Azure: </strong>IAAS, PAAS, XAAS, SAAS<strong>--</strong> WCF Services, BizTalk Services, and SQL database.</p><p>.<strong>Net Task Parallel Library:</strong> Facilitates and optimizes Multithreading via ParallelFor, ParallelForeach, Parallel.Invoke and Task constructs (all of which are utilized in the application). It provides the most efficient way on the Microsoft Stack to utilize CPU cores. ParallelFor and ParallelForEach loops are being used to facilitate calculations on large sets of independent assets and  Parallel.Invoke constructs are being used to execute multiple Tasks in Parallel.</p><p><strong>Team Foundation Server 4.0 (TFS): </strong>Features used include Source/Version Control, Work Item Tracking, and Team Build.</p><p><strong>SQL Server 2008 R2: </strong>Including SSAS (Dimensional Database), SSRS (Reporting),  and SSIS (Integration Services).</p><p><strong>ADO.Net 4.0:</strong> In particular, ADO.NET DataReaders are used for streaming and performance intensive operations. The Entity Framework in non-performance critical scenarios.</p><p><strong>System.Runtime.Caching: </strong>This namespace is completely decoupled from ASP.Net. Use is being made of Caching and Cache Dependencies (SQL and File—they cause a flush of the cache when the underlying source changes.</p><p><strong>Unity IOC</strong></p><p><strong>Visual Studio 2010</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10/2007- 	<strong>SOA, .Net Architect and Team Lead</strong>—<strong>Philips Electronics (health care services)</strong></p><p>02/2011	10/2007- Present--SOA, .Net Architect and Team Lead—Major Medical Service <br/>Company <br/><br/><strong>Assignment involves architectural design and heavy, multi-threaded coding</strong> in migrating company’s product from a legacy platform, based on C++, to a loosely <br/>coupled, multi-layered Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) via the .Net <br/>Framework, version 3.5 (C#, WCF, and WF), with the further constraint that the application support HL7/HIPPA compliant customers.<br/><br/><strong>Architecture has the classic 3 layers of an SOA</strong>, including an <br/>Orchestration Layer, an Entity Centric Business Services Layer, and an <br/>Application Services Layer exposing legacy portions of the original <br/>application, and containing reusable components devoid of business logic. <br/>Services were discovered via a Service Oriented Analysis, with the aid of <br/>a <strong>UML Domain Model</strong> that I constructed. </p><p><br/>Prototyped Orchestrations powered by <strong>BizTalk 2009 (use made of  BizTalk Editor, Mapper, Orchestrations, Business Rules Engine (BRE), BizTalk Adapters, and parallel processing within Orchestrations)</strong> and <strong>Windows Workflow <br/>Foundation (WF) .</strong>  Note that BizTalk Adapters were used to integrate with SAP, Seibel, and PeopleSoft.</p><p><br/><br/><strong>Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is being used to create the <br/>Business and Application Services</strong>, and some of the services have multiple <br/>“End Points.” This makes it possible to access the services through <br/>different protocols.

Based on the next generation of Radios to be introduced, client needed an application enabling their programmability via end users. My role in the process was multifold: 1) to analyze the existing application and propose a new architecture that would support an aggressive set of new features, 2) to implement a prototype managing various "constraints" between User Settings within the application, 3) and to work with the Platform Team to design an "Unpacking" algorithm of the Radios' "Code Plugs." The latest Microsoft Technologies were utilized (e.g. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), etc). C# was used as the development language.</p><p> </p><p>More specifically, I used UML to develop a "Domain Model" for the application and refined the portions of it related to the Constraint Management and the Platform Unpacking algorithm.</p><p> </p><p>I Prototyped a constraint mechanism that made it possible to change the rules of logic governing the constraints from an administrative front end. The distinction was, within the prototype, that the rules were completely decoupled from the application, so that the rules could change without having to recompile the application--similar functionality to the "Rules Repository" implemented in Microsoft BizTalk versions 2004 upwards.</p><p>	Additionally, I developed a management UI for the Prototype, via WPF.</p><p> </p><p>Worked with Offshore resources (Chengdo China) to enable the testing of the prototype vs. an alternative prototype.</p><p> </p><p>11/2004-		<strong>Dot Net Architect/Programmer: United States Sugar Corporation</strong></p><p>2/2006	<strong>Contract involves development and Integration of Enterprise Class Web and Windows Applications:</strong> </p><p><strong>Technologies Employed in the Web Form Applications: </strong>ASP.NET<strong>; </strong>ADO.NET<strong>;</strong>  Transact SQL; Stored Procedures; SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services; Web Services; Web Forms; A .NET “Class Library” Project, implementing the business and data access layers of a 4 tiered application; Visual Studio.NET, providing the fully integrated environment for development; and Visual SourceSafe. </p><p><strong>Technologies Employed in the Win Form Application: </strong>Visual Studio.NET Windows Application Project, Class Library Project (houses the business layer of 3 tiered application), Windows Service Project, Database Project, Deployment Project, SQL Server 2000, Transact SQL, Stored Procedures Database Triggers, Thread Synchronization Objects, Crystal Reports, and Visual SourceSafe. </p><p>Integration was achieved between the applications by applying the principles of Service Orientation.
