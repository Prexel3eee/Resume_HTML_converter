This project among others included a comprehensive Data Pipeline, multiple Data Lakes (Landing Zone, Processing Zone and Consumption zone), high level of domain Join security, Big Data Visualizations, Machine Learning, Deep Learning (CNN RNN). The architecture that we created is similar to Uber Gen-4 architecture with Hudi capable of processing tens of petabytes of streaming data. Please note that due to confidentiality and sensitivity I cannot and will not reveal specific technical details.</p><ul><li>I lead, architected and helped developing multiple Kubernetes projects on multiple large Kubernetes clusters. Initially we created POCs on AWS (EKS) and Azure (AKS) but finally decided to use the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in GCP for a number of reasons (more than welcome to ask me why in the interview). We created multiple clusters and deployed HDFS Spark in Kubernetes (up to 1000 pods), Kafka Confluent in Kubernetes (created both but decided on using pure Kafka up to 30 pods brokers in Kubernetes), Zookeeper in Kubernetes (up to 30 pods ZK), a comprehensive SOLR cluster in Kubernetes (50 SOLR pods), Elastic Search in Kubernetes (50 pods Elasticsearch) and other orchestrations. Please note that due to the StatefulSet nature, these projects were fairly complex using headless services for HDFS, Kafka, Zookeeper, SOLR, Elasticsearch etc however after deployments they were very reliable, scalable. For example with one replica command change in Helm Chart it would go from 5 node to 30 brokers Kafka in minutes. Could index from inside the dataproc into the SOLR kubernetes in a lightning speed. Used other component of the GCP among others Cloud Dataproc, BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Data Fusion, Cloud Dataprep, Data Catalog, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Kubernetes CLusters, Dataproc CLusters, Container Registry, CI/CD (CICD, CI CD,CI-CD) pipelines, Deep Learning Containers, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Firebase Realtime Database.

Using Confluent, Kafka Confluent both inside Kubernetes and outside, Kappa architecture with schema evolution, Avro, Parquet (similar to Uber Gen 4 architecture) we were able to ingest tens of terabytes of data a day like a charm. The Big Data part used Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka Confluent on mainly MapR but also interacting with Azure HDInsight, AWS EMR, and Kubernetes Cluster. Used also, Spark, Spark Streaming, Storm, Kafka Confluent, Hive, Pig, Impala, Flume, Sqoop, MapReduce, Pig, HBase, NiFi, oozie, Tableau Power BI and, Oozie, QlikView etc. Most of the code were written in Python, PySpark and Scala.</li><li>I lead, architected and helped developing a comprehensive Azure infrastructure working with ADF Azure Data Factory gen2, ADLS Azure Data Lake gen2, Data Catalog, Databricks, Delta Lake, Delta tables, Databricks Staging and Merge!
