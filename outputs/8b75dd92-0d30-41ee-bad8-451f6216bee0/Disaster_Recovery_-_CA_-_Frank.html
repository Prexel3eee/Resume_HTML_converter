This code was also  used as a backend for courses in distributed programming as part of IBM’s collaboration with Marist College. </p><p><br/>Wrote concept test Python programs that used Spark/PySpark.</p><p><strong><br/></strong>Have written add hoc software tools in REXX, C/C++, BAL, interfacing with z/OS, VTAM, and USS as needed. Some examples:</p><p><strong>VTAMTEST - </strong>A reentrant zSeries Assembler program, written using self written structuring, register management, and work area macros, to drive Netspool via VTAM for end to end testing of Infoprint Server. </p><p><strong>HEXDUMP -</strong> A C/C++ hexdump program. </p><p><strong>SYSVARS -</strong> A REXX routines to return System Info (OS Levels, JES Level, LPAR IDs etc.) and CVT,   ECVT,  and IHAIPA control block information (i.e. the D IPLINFO info) to assess newly onboarded systems more rapidly when TASID or other tools were not readily available. (SYSVARS)</p><p><strong>USSTEST1-4 -</strong> A series of USS REXX based routines to return UID, GID, GROUP and file system information to diagnose USS problems with Infoprint server during upgrades and steady state. These are particularly useful where RACF authority to list OMVS segments and group membership are not present. </p><p>Wrote a series of diagnostic programs using REXX and the REXX SOCKETS API to support analyzing network print issues</p><p><strong>SOCKET7 -</strong>  A diagnostic LPQ for mainframe command based on RFC1179 using REXX SOCKETS. Primarily to provide the ability to query queues of remote print servers while exposing TCP/IP errors. This had several benefits:</p><p><strong>1) Remote Queue Query </strong>- The IBM provided mainframe commad <strong>lpstat</strong> only queries the local Infoprint Server queues. <strong>lpq</strong> is not provided. In many environments the ability to query remote queues is useful.</p><p><strong>2) Expose TCP/IP Return Codes </strong>- In this diagnostic version all socket call returns are exposed. Often a "print" issue is actually a network issue.</p><p><strong>3) Ability to Work Through Firewall </strong>- Many distributed <strong>lpq</strong> commands do provide remote query, but their workstation IP address is often blocked. Being able to run on the sending mainframe solves this issue.</p><p><strong>RECVJOB - </strong>A diagnostic LPR for mainframe based on RFC1179 using REXX SOCKETS that exposes all TCP/IP and RFC1179 return codes and ACK/NACKs Used similarly to SOCKET7 above, but goes through the full RFC1179 process to send a data file and control file.</p><p><strong>LSTN9100 -</strong>  A diagnostic Port 9100 listener / server that accepts a direct sockets connection over TCP/IP and echos the incoming data to sysout for analysis</p><p><strong>DSOCKET -</strong> A direct sockets client used to connect to direct sockets servers or printers and sends a data steam for diagnostic purposes.</p><p><strong>LISTLIB2-3</strong> - REXX based programs to retrieve AFP Library info from old and new VOLSERs and Catalog to support z/OS migrations and ensure that in house resources were not lost when the standard IBM provided libraries were rolled in.</p><p>Collaborated with Toronto Open Source Development team members on port of Google v8 Javascript engine and node.js to Unix System Services under z/OS Environment as a stretch role.</p><p>Wrote simple test web applications (e.g. Hello World and CRUD) using Linux-Apache-Tomcat-MySQL-php stack (LAMP) with HTML, CSS, CSI, SSI, Java, Javascript, php and SQL. </p><p>Added Websphere Application Server (WAS) and DB2 under RHEL 7.7 to above stack.</p><p><strong>Mainframe Storage Support - Jazz                                                          Dates : 11/2010 – 04/2011</strong></p><p><strong>IBM - Dubuque GDF (direct)</strong></p><p>Responsible for Mainframe Storage management of approximately 30 IBM Global Delivery Facility (GDF) clients.</p><p>This included disk and tape using tools including IBM DFSMSdfp suite (DFSMSdfp, DFSMSdss, DFSMShsm, DFSMSrmm DFSMS OAM), ISMF, and third party products including Tape Management Systems (TMS), CA-1 and TLMS. And, occasionally scheduling software such as Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS aka OPC), and CA-7 and others.</p><p>Executed Requests for Service (RFS) that involved complex requirements as required by the client support/marketing teams.</p><p>Collaborated with other GDF Mainframe teams as needed. (E.g. MVS Support, DB2 Support, etc.)</p><p>Participated in Disaster Recovery Exercises (DRE) as a Mainframe Storage Representative (technical) for IBM both at IBM Business Continuity Centers (e.g. Sterling Forest) and remotely. </p><p>DASD devices supported included post 3390 devices such as Shark and Enterprise Storage Servers (ESS 2105-800, ESS 8000, DS8000 and similar).</p><p>Tape Subsystem support included Automated Tape Libraries (ATL), floor drives and Virtual Tape Systems (VTS). (E.g. 3494, etc.) </p><p>Provided source code development and maintenance support for storage related code written in the typical group of traditional mainframe languages (E.g. REXX, JCL. Assembler, and third party tools such as CA-EARL.)</p><p>Tracked Problem, Incident and Change tickets for storage systems support work using in house ticketing system Maximo as well as client systems using ManageNow, Remedy, Peregrine, InfoMan, and Impact. </p><p>Participated in twice daily cadence meetings to discuss issues, challenges, performance trends and exchange status and trouble-shooting information from other team members. </p><p>Assisted junior members with mainframe topics as needed (i.e. Rhythm and Blues levels).</p><p><strong>Software Developer - Commercial Products                                         Dates : 07/2006 – 10/2007</strong></p><p><strong>Vanguard Integrity Professionals (Vanguard Research Division, Orange Ca.)

Corporate Headquarters (Contract)</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Executed basic help desk procedures for Point of Sale (POS)  system support and related MVS or AS/400 systems.</p><p>The POS systems were OS/2 based LANs (Token rings or Ethernet) in each retail outlet which controlled cash registers, credit card readers and bar code readers while also generating management reports.  These were networked to AS/400  midrange or MVS mainframe systems.  </p><p>Help Desk access to POS systems on MVS mainframe was enhanced via Distributed Console Access Facility (DCAF) allowing help desk personnel take console control of systems in the field. </p><p>Help Desk local processing was facilitated via an OS/2 LAN using IBM OS/2 LAN Server.<strong> </strong>The Help Desk LAN was networked to available mainframes and AS/400s via OS/2 Communications Manager/2.<strong> </strong></p><p>This was a short term, business cycle related assignment (6 weeks).</p><p>During this time I submitted one process improvement for printer font servicing to Management. </p><p><strong>MVS System Programmer, JES2 and Program Products                             Dates : 01/93 - 05/94</strong></p><p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft  - Gov't Engines and Space Propulsion (GESP), Jupiter, Fl. </strong></p><p><strong>(Direct, Secret Clearance)</strong></p><p>While at GESP I held four progressively more responsible positions, the last of these being MVS Systems Programmer - JES2, with additional program products.</p><p>While in this role it was my responsibility to install and support JES2, TSO, AFP Products, MVS Compilers, OPC/ESA, TLMS, CA-Dispatch, CA-JCL Check and other assorted CA products used by Production Control.</p><p>During this time the primary focus was on commonality between the East Hartford and Florida operations, process improvements  and resolution of outstanding technical problems.</p><p>Aside from the commonality effort I implemented Wallace roll feed and automated report burster devices. On the software level this involved the suppression of system separator pages when applications produced an equivalent while generating bar code on application (e.g. CA-Dispatch) generated separators. This required modification of several JES2 and a CA-Dispatch exits and the creation of new separator page PAGEDEF / FORMDEFs for the various laser printers in use. By placing bar code on all relevant separator pages the efficiency of SYSOUT handling in Operations was improved by replacing manual bundle bursting with automated bursting.</p><p>An interesting problem resolution during this time was cleanup of system level S913 ABENDs caused by extraneous I/O appendages specified to the system that were no longer in the OS runtime libraries but specified in the appendage list.   This was done by  visually inspecting load module form macros in the OS  libraries and resolving discrepancies between PARMLIB and the OS libraries.  This was probably the first practical use of my interest in internals and machine level code diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Software Developer, System Programmer (MVS, VM Applications)           Dates : 11/91 - 01/93                                             </strong></p><p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft  - Gov't Engines and Space Propulsion (GESP), Jupiter, Fl.</strong></p><p><strong>(Direct, Secret Clearance)</strong></p><p>Responsible for the problem resolution, maintenance, and upgrading of many in-house and vendor software products used in the support of the Engineering Production Programming requirements on MVS and VM platforms along with some links to a Cray  XM-P/Unix platform.</p><p>Vendor Software products included CATIA, CAEDS, IGES,  PANVALET, VM Compilers and IMSL.</p><p>The following are descriptions of the main in-house written systems  supported :</p><p><strong>P</strong>rogram <strong>M</strong>aintenance <strong>R</strong>equest (<strong>PMR</strong>) - A multi platform (MVS/VM/Cray UNIX) change management system used to transition Engineering Test Files and programs to production libraries in both classified and unclassified environments. I  was given ownership of this legacy system and resolved many problem areas and created technical documentation which, at that time, was non existent and/or out of date.  </p><p>PMR was implemented in distributed fashion with sections positioned among 3 VM service machines, 2 MVS systems, and one Cray XM-P  with customer interface coding on mini disks on VM.  This system was mission critical to most engineering groups at Pratt &amp; Whitney, Florida. While supporting this system and coding assembler routines to transfer data and meet security standards I detected errors in the IBM written VM OS Simulation PDS routines. As a direct result IBM issued a corrective APAR for VM PDS directories.</p><p><strong>CLPUT/CLGET</strong> - The Security Group approved method of file transfer to and from classified environments. It consisted of 4 VM service machines with interfaces to MVS environments where required. It was implemented in distributed fashion being a server to both customer interfaces and PMR mentioned above and a client to MVS.  </p><p><strong>HSMPAN</strong> - A VM service machine and MVS batch based application used to transfer PANVALET library files to HSM tape backup at customer request from the VM/CMS command line to free online DASD space.  </p><p>It was implemented on a distributed model on VM treating both online customers and PMR as its clients and the MVS Batch environment as its server with provisions to manage and report on MVS batch job progress. </p><p>While in this position approximately 300 problems were tracked and resolved, a portion of which were related to the installation of a new version of the VM operating system.</p><p>Authored a 370 assembler program to copy classified MVS Partitioned Data Sets to VM OS Simulation Partitioned Data sets at the block level on a daily basis (via a VM service machine and shared DASD) between the MVS and VM OS images. </p><p>Several motivations for this existed. First, data formerly created on VM was being created to MVS PDS's with a new engineering data collector system. Second, was compliance with B1 Security regulations. Lastly, the original plan called for recompiling the VM source for the in house data post processing under MVS.  However, the source code was missing. </p><p>The subsequent solution called for a block level copy of data since VM OS Simulation PDS's have a fundamentally different internal file structure as compared to true MVS PDS's. Available copy utilities failed to reblock the MVS data as needed for the VM load modules. This program resulted in saving the resources required to recreate a large,  heavily used system by triggering cross platform file copies on a timed basis.  (This also led to APAR VM54976 from IBM.)</p><p><strong>Batch Production Control Analyst                                                                   Dates : 07/85 - 11/91</strong></p><p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft  - Gov't Engines and Space Propulsion (GESP), Jupiter, Fl.</strong></p><p><strong>(Direct, Secret Clearance) </strong> </p><p>Responsible for daily completion of Batch Production Job Streams. This included correcting abnormal end conditions and coordinating with appropriate programming groups and Computer Operations as required.</p><p>While serving in the role of Production Coordinator the following were also achieved :</p><p>Participated in Overnight Production ABEND Reduction Effort.  Designed and implemented data recording and reporting methods using CLIST, INFO/MAN,  370 Assembler Language, MVS JCL,  SAS and TELAGRAF.  As a team ABENDs were reduced approximately 50% during my time as a team member.   </p><p>Coordinated with the Automated Operations group to design and implement a useful Real Time ABEND Monitor based on Ops Automation under Netview.</p><p>Researched the applicability of MVS HiperBatch to Production Processing.  Research yielded applicability. However other priorities prevented Tech Support from bringing various system components up to required levels.</p><p>Developed and implemented "Data Center Alert" system.  An online/batch system to be used by programmers to inform Data Center of possible impacts of their projects on system requirements.  It was implemented in ISPF, CLIST, AFP and MVS JCL.</p><p>Researched the STOP X-37 ABEND reduction product and determined it was not useful at that time as it was incompatible with the then new SMS storage management system.</p><p>Developed the "Production Control Significant Events Log"  online turnover system which allowed Production Control and application programmers to communicate significant events across shift and departmental boundaries while providing an audit trail of special requests. </p><p>Participated in conversion of the production schedule system (approx. 10,000 MVS Jobs and related input processing) from CAMGR to OPC/ESA. During this conversion I developed several programs and exit modifications to facilitate seamless customer support during and after the conversion.  This included programs and JCL to integrate KEYMASTER keyed data and job control dependencies into the OPC/ESA system with minimal customer impact.  </p><p>Participated in conversion from the INFOREX input system to the KEYMASTER input system.  During this conversion I developed a 370 Assembler subroutine to be called from the central data input COBOL program that allowed the program to utilize any practical customer record length (DCBX).  It was modeled on IEBGENER, by copying DCB parms from the input DCB to the output DCB. This alleviated the need to have copies of the COBOL program for each record length to be processed.  Prior to this Production Control only allowed 80 and 131 character record lengths for customers utilizing Production Scheduling.</p><p>Developed several 370 Assembler programs that detected various types of empty data sets and issue condition codes or ABENDs. This allowed JCL step level determination of data availability saving effort required to redesign and recode many large COBOL accounting systems suffering S001 abends in such cases. The programs that issued condition codes allowed job step level logic to be implemented. Programs that issued ABENDs allowed Scheduler level logic to be employed. This resulted in reduced manual effort on the part of programmers and JCL analysts to complete job strings achieving smoother job flow  and  reduced support effort and cost.</p><p>Engaged in Six Sigma training.</p><p><strong>Peripheral Operator : Mainframe Operations                                               Dates : 01/84 - 07/85</strong></p><p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft  - Gov't Engines and Space Propulsion (GESP), Jupiter, Fl.</strong></p><p><strong>(Direct, Secret Clearance) </strong> </p><p>Responsible for operation and maintenance of IBM , Kodak, and Versatec printing subsystems hardware.
