PROFESSIONAL PROFILE
As an experienced Project Delivery expert, specialized in leading enterprise projects within the
pharmaceutical and life science industry, addressing budget constraints and prior setbacks. The approach
involves assembling dedicated teams, analyzing past failures, and establishing effective strategies to achieve
project milestones without compromising quality.
Under this leadership, strict compliance with pharmaceutical manufacturing guidelines was ensured, an Audit
Defense System for GAMP 5 compliance was developed, and collaboration with regulatory authorities such
as FDA, ANVISA, DGFT, KFDA, TGA, BDA, CFDA, and EMA was initiated to combat counterfeit drug
production.
Consultancy services were extended to assist over 28 pharmaceutical firms in meeting the requirements of the
US DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) regulation. These services were facilitated through close
collaborations with prominent pharmaceutical industry leaders, including TEVA, TARO, Breckenridge,
Alvogen, Rising Pharma, and Sun Pharmaceuticals, resulting in the delivery of customized solutions.
Technology Used: SAP SD, SAP PP, SAP ATTP, TraceLink, ASP.net, SQL Server 2016, XML, Web Services,
Project Management Tools.
January 2014 to To-date SolutionsMax Technology Services. Sacramento, CA
Principal Project Consultant
In this role, I provided comprehensive support to SolutionsMax customers across various domains. This
involved delivering technical services for SAP implementation, ensuring compliance with regulatory practices,
and providing quality management services. Additionally, I actively contributed to project management service
delivery, ensuring projects were executed within scope, schedule, and cost constraints. I worked on the Drug
Serialization Project on the SAP ATTP platform and TraceLink Platform for regulatory agencies such as US
FDA, MHRA, and TGA. I authored articles and conducted training on DSCSA Guidelines for the FDA,
assisting numerous customer partner sites outside the USA with onboarding.
Responsibilities have encompassed the deployment of Quality Management Systems (QMS), which have been
seamlessly integrated with Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) and Customer Complaints Handling
(CCF) processes. In addition to this, a pivotal role has been played in the architectural design of Pharma
Ecosystem solutions, which are currently in the final stages of implementation.
During my tenure at SolutionsMax, the opportunity has arisen to serve esteemed life science and
pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to Merck, Natco, Rising Pharma, Breckenridge, Sun
Pharma, TEVA, TARO, Alvogen, and various others. Implemented Serialization/Track & Trace specifically
at these pharmaceutical firms.
The latest implementation occurred at Rising Pharma in Decatur, Ilinois, where I successfully developed the
strategy SOP for a Serialization solution on ACG Package equipment utilizing SAP ATTP Serialization.
March, 2011 to August 2013 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp Whitehouse Station, NJ
Solutions/Engagement Manager(Consultant)
Active involvement was maintained in the migration of legacy source systems employed during the pre-
clinical trial phase of operations. This endeavor posed specific challenges, with a primary focus on the
necessity for stringent adherence to Merck's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Good Laboratory
Practice (GLPx) Compliance policies. Risks associated with the project encompassed the need to ensure
continued access to and support for the legacy source data formats, in addition to compliance requirements
pertaining to these systems.
To effectively address these challenges and mitigate associated risks, an agile project management
methodology was introduced. This approach played a pivotal role in maintaining equilibrium among the
critical triple constraints of Schedule, Cost, and Scope, ensuring that none of these essential factors were
compromised throughout the migration process.
January, 2003 to December, 2008 GlaxoSmithKline Pl Philadelphia, PA
